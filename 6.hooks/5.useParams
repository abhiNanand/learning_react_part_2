UseParams: allows us to access dynamic parameters from the URL. useful with working with dynamic routes. 

How useParams works:

-returns an object containing key-value pair,where keys corresponds to     dynamic parameters in the route path. 
- This is useful when defining routes with dynamic segments(e.g.,:userId).
- Child routes inherit all parameters from their parent routes.
