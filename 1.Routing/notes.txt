What is Routing ?  
= Routing is the process of determining which content or page should be displayed when a user navigates through a website. 
Helps in handling different url's and showing the corret content accordingly. 

Why is Routing Improtant?
-Routing is essential because it allows users to move between different   sections or pages of a website smoothly. Without routing, everytime a user clicks a link, the entire page would reload, which can be slow and inefficient.

enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for the next page. It also enables more dynamic user experiences with things like animation.

How is Routing Done? (Only Intro)
Routing can be done in two main ways:

Server-Side Routing – The server processes the request and sends a new page every time a user navigates.
Client-Side Routing – The browser updates the page dynamically without reloading it from the server.

=============================================================================

Client Side routing ?

-Client-side routing is when the browser changes the dispaly content without refreshing the page. 

How It Works
------------ 
-Instead of requesting a new page from the server, React updates the content dynamicalyy. 

-The url changes, but the page is updated instantly using Javascript. 
-Data is fetched when needed (using fetch or Apis), instead of reloading the whole page. 
=============================================================================


How to create Client Side Routing
---------------------------------- 

Client side routing is enabled by creating a Router and linking/submitting to pages with Link and <Form>:

install this  in you react app using this command:-
npm install react-router-dom

===========================================================

ek page se dushre page hum log html me v ja saktey hai using this syntax.
<a href="index.html">Go to Page 1</a>
<a href="index2.html">Go to Page 2</a>
If you use an <a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2</a> tag in React: ❌ It refreshes the entire page
❌ Loses all state & data
❌ Not a true SPA behavior

=============================================================================

Why Do We Need React Router?
React is a Single Page Application (SPA) framework, meaning:

It does not reload the page when navigating.
Everything happens on one HTML file (index.html).
Navigation must be handled without refreshing the browser.
React Router enables client-side navigation, meaning: ✅ No full page reload


These things can be also done with js but react router provides a structured and declarative way to handle routing in React application.
In vanilla JS, you'd have to manually manipulate the DOM (document.querySelector, innerHTML), which is error-prone.

React Router simplifies and optimizes it for React applications by making routing: ✅ Declarative
✅ Component-driven
✅ Scalable & maintainable
✅ Easy to integrate with state & authentication

React as a library vs React Router as a framework
------------------------------------------------- 

1️⃣ React Router as a Library
📌 Definition: A library provides specific functionality that can be added to an existing project without dictating the overall structure.

✅ Key Characteristics:

React Router is a standalone package (react-router-dom) that helps with client-side routing.
You manually integrate it into your React project.
You decide how to structure your routes and handle navigation.
Here, React Router is just a tool to manage navigation, but the project structure is still fully controlled by the developer.

🟢 Pros:
✔️ More flexibility
✔️ Can be used in any React project
✔️ Lightweight

🔴 Cons:
❌ More manual setup
❌ No built-in conventions



2️⃣ React Router as a Framework
------------------------------- 
2️⃣ React Router as a Framework
📌 Definition: A framework provides a more structured environment, guiding how an app is built and including routing as a core feature.

✅ Key Characteristics:

React Router is used as a foundational part of a framework like Remix.
It provides opinionated structure, handling things like:
File-based routing
Server-side rendering (SSR) integration
Data fetching with loaders and actions
Navigation, route hierarchy, and data handling are deeply integrated.
✅ Example (Remix with React Router as a Framework):

In Remix, routing is handled automatically based on files.
React Router is embedded into the framework’s data-fetching and rendering system.
🟢 Pros:
✔️ More structured and maintainable
✔️ Optimized performance with SSR, loaders, and actions
✔️ Better SEO support

🔴 Cons:
❌ Less flexibility
❌ Requires learning framework-specific concepts

Conclusion:
If you just need routing in a React app → Use React Router as a Library (react-router-dom).
If you want a structured framework with routing, SSR, and built-in data handling → Use Remix (React Router as a Framework
